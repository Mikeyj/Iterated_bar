Iterated_bar
============

Common visualisations of OTU data include pie charts (evil) and stacked bars. Both lack the ability to directly compare proportions as the former is hard to judge and the latter have variable baselines for each OTU.  

Iterated stacked bars equalise the baselines and can help with looking at changing proportions.  This is my attempt to do this in R.

It is also my first repository and an attempt to get to grips with github, pardon my dust.
